# LeetCode Solutions & Algorithm Analysis

A comprehensive collection of LeetCode problem solutions focused on algorithmic efficiency, clean Pythonic implementation, and rigorous complexity analysis.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository documents my progress through the **NeetCode 150** and other competitive programming challenges. The goal is to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) while exploring the internal optimization of the Python language (CPython).

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Methodologies
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Optimization Patterns:**
  - Character Counting / Prime Factorization for Hash Map Keys.
  - Heap-based selection for Top-K problems.
  - Two-pointer and Sliding Window techniques.
- **Tools:** VS Code, Oh My Zsh (Powerlevel10k), Git.

## 📊 Learning Objectives
* **Time & Space Complexity:** Analyzing every solution using Big O notation.
* **Pythonic Efficiency:** Leveraging built-in C-optimized modules like `collections.Counter` and `heapq`.
* **Code Clarity:** Writing self-documenting code with clear English comments for academic and professional environments.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each solution is categorized by the problem's topic and includes a detailed explanation of the approach used, ranging from brute force to the most optimized version.
